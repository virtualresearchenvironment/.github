## Welcome to the VRE
The BIH/Charité Virtual Research Environment (VRE) is a GDPR-ready data management platform that enables medical researchers to store, find, access, analyse, and share their data, including sensitive data, thus reducing barriers to biomedical research and innovation.  The VRE is developed in collaboration with Charité Business Division IT (GB IT) and industry partner Indoc Research.


## Features of the VRE
The VRE is a module of the BIH Charité Health Data Platform systems (HDP), a component of the BIH Translational Hub Digital Medicine, and leverages that system’s generic big data infrastructure including its computing and storage resources.  The VRE provides additional specialized methodology and technology capabilities for data processing, data management, visualization, and analysis.  Features of the VRE include:
- A web portal with project- and role-based access controls and federated identity management system
- A segregated “Green Room” zone to capture and pre- process sensitive data to prepare it for analysis
- Analytics workbench tools for processing, analysing, and visualizing datasets
- Automated ingestion of data from hospital-based data capture sources
- Project-specific Data Warehouse for ingestion and query of structured datasets
- Metadata repository and graph database for capture and query of metadata and lineage tracking, and support for ontologies and automated extraction and indexing of standard metadata fields to make data findable

## User Documentation
The [VRE Public Wiki](https://vre.charite.de/xwiki/wiki/vrepublic/view/Main/) provides extensive user documentation including a User Guide with detailed information about the features and services within the VRE, and other information for the [VRE Community](https://vre.charite.de/xwiki/wiki/vrepublic/view/Main/VRE_Community/community_meetings/).


## Open Source Software
The VRE open-source software release is in progress and the code base will be updated periodically.  Check out the repositories for the latest updates.
